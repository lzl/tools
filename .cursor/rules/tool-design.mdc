# Python Tool Design Principles

## Tool Design
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each tool focuses on one thing only, with decoupled functionality
- Each Python file is an independent tool
- Each tool should have a `main()` function as the entry point
- Tools should not have dependencies on each other, maintaining independence

## Project Structure
- Each tool is an independent `.py` file
- Use PEP 723 inline script metadata at the top of each script file:
  ```python
  # /// script
  # dependencies = []
  # ///
  ```
- Call via `uv run <file>.py` (e.g., `uv run file_size.py`)
- Scripts are self-contained and don't require project installation

## Code Standards
- Use standard command-line argument processing (`sys.argv`)
- Provide clear error messages and usage instructions
- Keep code simple and readable

## Adding Dependencies
- Use `uv add --script <file>.py <dependency>` to add dependencies to a script
- Dependencies will be automatically added to the inline script metadata
- Example: `uv add --script file_size.py requests`

# Rust Tool Design Principles

## Tool Design
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each tool focuses on one thing only, with decoupled functionality
- Each Rust file is an independent tool
- Each tool should have a `main()` function as the entry point
- Tools should not have dependencies on each other, maintaining independence

## Project Structure
- Each tool is an independent `.rs` file
- Use embedded `Cargo.toml` metadata at the top of each script file:
  ```rust
  #!/usr/bin/env -S cargo +nightly -Zscript
  ---
  [dependencies]
  ---
  ```
- Run via `cargo +nightly -Zscript <file>.rs` (e.g., `cargo +nightly -Zscript file_size.rs`)
- Scripts are self-contained and don't require project installation

## Prerequisites
- Install Rust: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
- Install nightly toolchain: `rustup install nightly`

## Code Standards
- Use standard command-line argument processing (`std::env::args`)
- Provide clear error messages and usage instructions
- Keep code simple and readable

## Adding Dependencies
- Add dependencies to the embedded `Cargo.toml` section in the script
- Example:
  ```rust
  ---
  [dependencies]
  clap = "4.0"
  ---
  ```
