# Tool Design Principles

## Tool Design
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each tool focuses on one thing only, with decoupled functionality
- Each Python file is an independent tool
- Each tool should have a `main()` function as the entry point
- Tools should not have dependencies on each other, maintaining independence

## Project Structure
- Each tool is an independent `.py` file
- Use PEP 723 inline script metadata at the top of each script file:
  ```python
  # /// script
  # dependencies = []
  # ///
  ```
- Call via `uv run <file>.py` (e.g., `uv run file_size.py`)
- Scripts are self-contained and don't require project installation

## Code Standards
- Use standard command-line argument processing (`sys.argv`)
- Provide clear error messages and usage instructions
- Keep code simple and readable

## Adding Dependencies
- Use `uv add --script <file>.py <dependency>` to add dependencies to a script
- Dependencies will be automatically added to the inline script metadata
- Example: `uv add --script file_size.py requests`
