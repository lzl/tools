# Tool Design Principles

## Tool Design
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each tool focuses on one thing only, with decoupled functionality
- Each Python file is an independent tool
- Each tool should have a `main()` function as the entry point
- Tools should not have dependencies on each other, maintaining independence

## Project Structure
- Each tool is an independent `.py` file
- Configure script entry points in `pyproject.toml` under `[project.scripts]`
- Call via `uv run <script-name>` or `uv run python <file>.py`

## Code Standards
- Use standard command-line argument processing (`sys.argv`)
- Provide clear error messages and usage instructions
- Keep code simple and readable
